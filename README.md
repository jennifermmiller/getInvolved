getInvolved
===========

This is my final project from my time at The Iron Yard. We were given two and a half weeks to come up with an idea, write specs, wireframe, design, and then implement everything. 

Description: A meetup-esque app that targets both people/organizations that need extra help and those who wish to get involved in their community. Users can either post a volunteer event or search events and signup for one. After the date of an event, it is removed using a Parse Cloud Code function. When a user signs up for an event, a confirmation email is sent to both volunteer and the event sponsor.

Disclaimer: This is still a work in progress. In my spare time I am going back to do some refactoring and tying up of loose ends.
